# Robot Control Stack

**Robot Control Stack (RCS)** is a unified and multilayered robot control interface over a MuJoCo simulation and real-world robots. It is designed to be a lean ecosystem for robot learning at scale.

## Features

- **Unified Interface**: Seamlessly switch between simulation (MuJoCo) and real hardware.
- **Layered Architecture**: 
    - **High-Level**: Gymnasium-based Python API for RL and general control.
    - **Low-Level**: C++ core with Python bindings for performance-critical tasks.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new robots and sensors via C++ or Python extensions.
- **Lean**: Minimal dependencies and overhead.
