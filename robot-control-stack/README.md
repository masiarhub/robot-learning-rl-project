**Robot Control Stack (RCS)** is a flexible, native [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) wrapper-based robot control interface designed specifically for modern robot learning and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. 

It completely unifies **MuJoCo simulation** and real-world physical robot control into a single, seamless API. Currently, RCS natively supports four robots out-of-the-box: **Franka FR3/Panda, xArm7, UR5e, and SO101.**

## 🚀 Why use Robot Control Stack?

Traditional robotics middleware (like ROS/ROS2) and complex motion planning pipelines (like MoveIt or standard `ros2_control`) are built for asynchronous, distributed systems. This often becomes a massive bottleneck when attempting to train modern, synchronous machine learning models.

**RCS is built differently:**
* **Zero ROS Overhead:** No complex message-passing, middleware, or network configuration required. Run natively in Python with a lightweight C++ backend.
* **Frictionless Sim-to-Real:** Train your Reinforcement Learning or VLA policies in our MuJoCo Gymnasium wrapper, and deploy the *exact same code* directly to physical hardware.
* **Synchronous Execution:** Optimized specifically for the highly parallelized, synchronous data collection required by modern ML workflows.
* **Ready-to-Use Apps:** Ships with pre-built applications for data collection via teleoperation and remote model inference via [vlagents](https://github.com/RobotControlStack/vlagents).

## 🧩 Wrapper-Based Architecture

RCS utilizes a highly modular, wrapper-based architecture, allowing you to easily stack capabilities (cameras, grippers, action spaces) as needed.

## 💻 Example: Composing your Environment

Flexibly compose your Gymnasium environment to fit your exact training needs. *For common environment compositions, factory functions such as `rcs.envs.creators.SimEnvCreator` are provided.*

```python
from time import sleep

import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np
from rcs._core.sim import SimConfig
from rcs.camera.sim import SimCameraSet
from rcs.envs.base import (
    CameraSetWrapper,
    ControlMode,
    CoverWrapper,
    GripperWrapper,
    RelativeActionSpace,
    RelativeTo,
    RobotWrapper,
    SimEnv,
)
from rcs.envs.scenes import EmptyWorldFR3
from rcs.envs.sim import GripperWrapperSim, RobotSimWrapper

import rcs
from rcs import sim

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # default configs
    scene = EmptyWorldFR3()
    cfg = scene.prefixed_cfg(scene.config())
    fr3 = scene.lead_robot_name(cfg)

    robot_cfg = cfg.robot_cfgs[fr3]
    gripper_cfg = cfg.gripper_cfgs[fr3]  # type: ignore
    camera_cfgs = cfg.camera_cfgs
    sim_cfg = SimConfig(
        realtime=True,
        async_control=True,
        frequency=1,  # in Hz (1 sec delay)
    )
    mjmodel = scene.create_model(cfg)
    kinematic_model_path, attachment_site = scene.kinematics_cfg(cfg)[fr3]

    simulation = sim.Sim(mjmodel, sim_cfg)
    ik = rcs.common.Pin(
        kinematic_model_path,
        attachment_site,
    )

    # base env
    robot = rcs.sim.SimRobot(simulation, ik, robot_cfg)
    env: gym.Env = SimEnv(simulation)
    env = RobotWrapper(env, robot, ControlMode.CARTESIAN_TQuat)

    # gripper
    gripper = sim.SimGripper(simulation, gripper_cfg)
    env = GripperWrapper(env, gripper)

    env = RobotSimWrapper(env)
    env = GripperWrapperSim(env)

    # camera
    camera_set = SimCameraSet(simulation, camera_cfgs, physical_units=True, render_on_demand=True)  # type: ignore
    env = CameraSetWrapper(env, camera_set, include_depth=True)  # type: ignore

    # relative actions bounded by 10cm translation and 10 degree rotation
    env = RelativeActionSpace(env, max_mov=(0.1, np.deg2rad(10)), relative_to=RelativeTo.LAST_STEP)
    env = CoverWrapper(env)

    env.get_wrapper_attr("sim").open_gui()
    # wait for gui to open
    sleep(1)
    env.reset()

    # access low level robot api to get current cartesian position
    print(env.get_wrapper_attr("robot").get_cartesian_position())

    for _ in range(10):
        # move 1cm in x direction (forward) and close gripper
        act = {"tquat": [0.01, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "gripper": [0]}
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(act)
        print(obs)
```

## 🛠️ Installation

### From Source

Make sure that common build tools (i.e., `build-essential`) and a C++ compiler like `gcc` or `clang` are installed on your system/conda/docker.

*RCS works best in Python 3.11, and all extensions have been tested to work in 3.11.*

* *For Python >3.11: The `rcs_realsense` extension won't work due to the `pyrealsense2` version RCS utilizes.*
* *For Python >3.12: The `ompl` python module is currently not available on PyPI. If OMPL is not used, it is safe to remove this dependency in `pyproject.toml`.*

```shell

# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/RobotControlStack/robot-control-stack.git
cd robot-control-stack

# setup environment
conda create -n rcs python=3.11
conda activate rcs
conda install conda-forge::glfw

# or sudo apt install $(cat debian_deps.txt)
pip install 'pip>=25.1'
pip install --group build_deps

# install rcs
pip install -ve .

```

### Via PyPI/pip

*Coming soon...*

## 🦾 Hardware Extensions

RCS supports various hardware extensions to seamlessly connect your policies to the real world (e.g., FR3, xArm7, RealSense). These are located in the `extensions` directory.

To install a specific robot extension (example for Franka FR3):

```shell
sudo apt install $(cat extensions/rcs_fr3/debian_deps.txt)
pip install -ve extensions/rcs_fr3
```

For a full list of extensions and detailed documentation, visit **[robotcontrolstack.org/extensions](https://robotcontrolstack.org/extensions)**.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting & FAQ
* **License error or group argument not found during installation?** Make sure you are using a pip version `>=25.1` and setuptools version `>=45`.
* **Dependency error during installation?** Make sure you are using Python 3.11. RCS extensions currently do not support 3.12+ due to OMPL and RealSense dependencies.
* **Simulation is running too slow?** Check that you have enable on-demand rendering: `SimCameraSet(..., render_on_demand=True)` to render camera frames only once per step. Resolution and number of cameras in the scene has a large impact on simulation speed. Make sure to use a decent GPU when rendering is enabled.
